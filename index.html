    <h1> Homework 10.3 JS Tasks</h1>

    <div class= contianer> 
        <div class="task1">
        <h2>Task 1</h2> 
        <p>  Given a string of odd characters with lengths more than 5 and less than 50. Write a function to extract the middle 3 characters
        <br>  Input : “aacjddfdd“
        <br> Output : jdd</p>
        <br>
        <p class="answer1"> </p>
    </div>


    <div class="task2">
        <h2>Task 2</h2> 
         <p> Write a function to return if the number is a prime number or not
         <br> Input between- 1 to 100
         <br> Output should be in array , First number tell if its prime number or not and second output tell the next prime number moving towards 100
         <br> For example
         <br> Input : 47  Output ; [true , 53]
         <br> Since 47 is prime number , we returned true and next prime number moving towards 100 is 53
         </p>
         <br>
         <p class="answer2"> </p>
    </div>


    <div class="task3">
        <h2>Task 3</h2>
        <p>Write a function that calculates a number of digits.This challenge requires you to calculate the run-length encoding of a string. This compresses the string in the following way: wherever there are multiple repeating characters in a string, replace them with the character count along with the original character. For example: the string "aaabbc" results in an encoding of "3a2b1c" You can see that the count comes first followed by the character.

    <div class="task4">
        <h2> Task 4 </h2>
        <p>  Given a string of input of word consisting entirely of alphabets .
        <br> For each alphabet in input , you have to do two things
        <br> change alphabet to next alphabet – Ex “a” become “b” , “d” become “e”
        <br> If its lower case it becomes uppercase and vice versa
        <br> Ex Input - chIme
        <br> Output-- DImNF
        <br> first letter c become capital D
        <br> second letter h becomes capital I
        <br> third l become small m </p>
